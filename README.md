# MkiiStepSequencer_JavaEdition
a much-needed re-design of my python step sequencer (here: https://github.com/sqrtM/arturia_mkii_step_sequencer), now in java.

the sequencer works by through bitwise operations which track the beat's location within the sequence as well as the notes which the user has marked as "active".
